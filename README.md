### How to use Git for the project
### Set up git environment
<pre>
1. Create a folder (don't use cloud drive because it is unstable to work with github)
2. Download this repository
        sh> git clone https://github.com/wesnjazz/CS377_chatsystem.git
3. go to CS377_chatsystem folder.
4. check your git status
        sh> git status
5. check branches that already made. You will see there are individual branches for each member.
    <b>You need to work on only your branch.</b>
        sh> git branch -a
6. checkout to your branch
        <b>sh> git checkout shipeng</b>   or
        <b>sh> git checkout ruifeng</b>
7. Now you are done with setup.
</pre>

### When you do your tasks
<pre>
1. Always work on your branch
    sh> git checkout [mybranch]
